- **Acceptance criteria** for each deliverable
- **Implementation code examples** and architecture decisions
- **Risk mitigation strategies** with fallback plans
- **Testing requirements** and validation procedures
- **Documentation needs** and deliverables checklist

## Development Workflow

1. **Start with Phase 1** and complete all tasks before moving to the next phase
2. **Track progress** using the provided checklists in each plan
3. **Validate deliverables** against the acceptance criteria
4. **Document deviations** from the planned approach for future reference
5. **Prepare for next phase** using the transition guidelines

## Time Estimates
