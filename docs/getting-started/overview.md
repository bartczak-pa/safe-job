# Getting Started with Safe Job Platform

Welcome to the Safe Job Platform development documentation! This guide will help you understand the project structure and get oriented with our comprehensive documentation.

## üìã What is Safe Job?

Safe Job is a platform designed to connect legitimate hiring agencies with temporary workers in the Netherlands, with a strong focus on:

- **Worker Safety** - Protecting workers from exploitation and unsafe conditions
- **Employer Verification** - Ensuring all hiring agencies are legitimate and compliant
- **Efficient Matching** - Smart job-candidate matching with location-based search
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Full GDPR and Dutch labor law compliance

## üéØ Project Goals

### MVP Objectives
- Create a secure, trusted platform for job matching
- Implement robust employer verification system
- Provide real-time communication between parties
- Ensure mobile-first, accessible user experience

### Technical Objectives  
- Build with Django/React for rapid development
- Deploy on AWS Free Tier for cost efficiency
- Implement comprehensive security measures
- Maintain high code quality and documentation

## üìñ Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized into four main sections:

### 1. Business Documentation
**What we're building and why**

- [Business Concept](../business/business-concept.md) - Market analysis and value proposition
- [Product Requirements](../business/prd.md) - Detailed feature specifications and user stories

### 2. Architecture Documentation
**How we're building it technically**

- [System Architecture](../architecture/architecture.md) - Complete technical design and decisions
- [Authentication System](../architecture/authentication.md) - Security implementation details
- [Internationalization](../architecture/internationalization.md) - Multi-language strategy

### 3. Implementation Documentation
**Step-by-step development plan**

- [Project Plan](../plan.md) - Overall timeline and risk assessment
- [Phase Documentation](../phases/phase-1-foundation.md) - Detailed implementation phases

### 4. Development Resources
**Tools and processes for building**

- GitHub repository setup and workflows
- Docker development environment
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Testing and quality assurance procedures

## üöÄ Quick Navigation

### For Business Stakeholders
Start with the [Business Concept](../business/business-concept.md) to understand the market opportunity and value proposition.

### For Product Managers
Review the [Product Requirements Document](../business/prd.md) for complete feature specifications.

### For Developers
Begin with the [System Architecture](../architecture/architecture.md) and then dive into [Phase 1 Implementation](../phases/phase-1-foundation.md).

### For Project Managers
Check out the [Project Plan](../plan.md) for timeline, risks, and success metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Approach

### Single Developer + AI
This project is designed for efficient development by a single full-stack developer with AI assistance (Claude Code).

### Modular Architecture
Built as a Django monolith with clear domain separation, enabling future scaling to microservices if needed.

### Quality Focus
Comprehensive testing, security measures, and documentation maintained throughout development.

### Iterative Development
8-week MVP with continuous feedback loops and regular milestone reviews.
